                The background of the Data Technology Laboratory (DT Lab) stems from the rapid development of information technology, which is transforming the way people work, learn, and interact. This change demands an academic space that serves not only as a place for theoretical learning but also as a practical platform for understanding and mastering digital technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data science. With this laboratory, students and researchers can develop relevant skills while producing innovations that meet the needs of the times.            
            </p>     
            <p>
                The urgency behind establishing the DT Lab stems from the increasing reliance of industry on digital solutions, as well as the need for higher education to develop competent human resources. Without dedicated facilities, the learning process will struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving dynamics of technology. Therefore, the DT Lab serves as a crucial platform for bridging the gap between academic theory and industrial practice, while strengthening cross-disciplinary collaboration in addressing the challenges of digital transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary objective of establishing the DT Lab is to provide research, development, and innovation facilities for students, lecturers, and industry partners. This laboratory is expected to improve the quality of human resources, encourage the creation of applicable digital works, and make a tangible contribution to various sectors of life. Thus, the DT Lab will not only become a center for learning, but also a hub for collaboration and the development of impactful digital solutions.
